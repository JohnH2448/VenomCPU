Notes:

- IMEM must have two outputs, DATA and VALID. VALID must
be 1 only if DATA corresponds to the current PC. PC may
change mid IMEM fetch, and VALID must not raise until the
correct data arrives. In flight fetching must adapt to PC
change and gate VALID respectively. 

- DMEM LOADS function with the same VALID bit handshake as
IMEM. Addresses will be asserted in the address register, and
VALID must always be true only when the correct data is at port.
DMEM LOAD, unlike IMEM, will not change address until VALID arrives

- DMEM STORES take a VALID data bit to sample on, and a COMPLETE
handshake on store completion. on VALID posedge, memory writes the data 
in the data output port to the address in the address output port. 
COMPLETE can be asserted early only if a next CPU cycle LOAD would
fetch the newly stored data.
